# Overview
Shahi Sawari is a private limited that provides pick and drop service via auto-rickshaws for daily affordable commute. This project aims to use unsupervised learning techniques to explore patterns of driver behavior and how the company can optimize its service. The study is aimed to analyze the following areas:  

•	Fairness of the Dispatch Algorithm System
•	Relationship between the acceptance/rejection rate and fare earned by the drivers
•	The variability of acceptance/rejection rate with respect to particular geographical area
•	Relationship between the acceptance/rejection rate and the distance of the driver from the pickup location
•	Relationship between the acceptance/rejection rate and the total trip distance (from pickup location to drop-off location)
•	The fluctuation of demand with respect to time and day
